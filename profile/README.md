We __think up, create and ship__ software for organisations and individuals who embrace __societal change__.

The world is in flux, and it's a unique opportunity to facilitate change for the better. We want to enable the makers that are driving this change by providing them with __independent, fair and tailor made software__ that meets the highest standards when it comes to transparency, integrity and privacy.

__Located in Berlin__, we're a small, reliable and well-rehearsed team of seniors that can take care of your software project from first brainstorming to going live.

__Working fully open source__ allows us to be transparent, keep in touch with the community, and contribute back to an ever growing common body of freely available knowledge.

Our clients value __simple, resilient and accessible__ tools that are effortless to run and maintain, and that everyone can use, reuse and benefit from.
